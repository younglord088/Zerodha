# Zerodha Frontend Clone

This project aims to replicate the frontend design and functionality of the Zerodha stock market broker platform. Zerodha is known for its user-friendly interface and comprehensive features for trading stocks, derivatives, mutual funds, and more. By cloning its frontend, we intend to provide a similar experience to users who are familiar with Zerodha or want to explore its interface.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The frontend will be built to ensure compatibility across various devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
- **User Authentication**: Users can sign up, log in, and manage their accounts securely.
- **Dashboard**: A personalized dashboard will display real-time market data, portfolio overview, watchlists, and account information.
- **Trading**: Users can buy and sell stocks, derivatives, and mutual funds through an intuitive and efficient trading interface.
- **Market Analysis Tools**: Incorporate tools for technical analysis, charting, and research to aid users in making informed investment decisions.
